### Scratch and Sandbox

There is a `Scratch` directory in the repo but it is 'ignored' so nothing in there should ever be
commited unless someone does something very intentional.  Please don't do something very
intentional.  Scratch is a great place to experiment with small throwaway efforts.  It's best to
treat scratch as if it's always going to be ok if it get's deleted.

There is an other directory `Sandbox`.  This is intended for tinkering in a way that you would
like to persist.  E.g. a proof of concept that you think you'll need later.  Or perhaps something
that you would like to share with the project group.  Make sure that anything we rely on for the
project, experiments, results or report are not left in here.  Everything that is part of our
evaluated work should be moved up into the main code/project directories.
